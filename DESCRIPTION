Description: Scalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly optimized
        C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure (GDS) files.
        It is designed for single variant tests in large-scale phenome-wide association
        studies (PheWAS) with millions of variants and samples, controlling for sample
        structure and case-control imbalance. The implementation is based on the original
        SAIGE R package (v0.29.4.4). SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest
        functions in C to speed up the calculation of Saddlepoint approximation.
        Benchmarks show that SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster than the original SAIGE R
        package.
