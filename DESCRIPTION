Description: Scalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly
        optimized C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure
        (GDS) files. It is designed for single variant tests in large-scale
        phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) with millions of variants and
        samples, controlling for sample structure and case-control imbalance.
        The implementation is based on the original SAIGE R package (v0.29.4.4).
        SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest functions in C to speed up
        the calculation of Saddlepoint approximation. Benchmarks show that
        SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster than the original SAIGE R package.
