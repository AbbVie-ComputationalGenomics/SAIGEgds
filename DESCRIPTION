Description: Scalable and accurate implementation of generalized mixed models
        with the support of Genomic Data Structure (GDS) files and highly optimized
        C++ implementation. It is designed for single variant tests in large-scale
        phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) with millions of variants and
        thousands of samples. The implementation is based on the original SAIGE R
        package (v0.29.4). SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest functions in
        C to speed up the calculation of Saddlepoint Approximation. Benchmarks show
        that SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster than the original SAIGE R package.
